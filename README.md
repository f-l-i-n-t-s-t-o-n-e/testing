# testing

this is a minimum viable product for a trading interface where you can bet on coin prices or competitions like sports games in a fully non interactive way which means after you make a bet everything is handled behind the scenes and your winnings just show up in your account after the event has concluded

you can also be the house and LP by copying professional odds with one click. all major sports supported

you can also do cross-network bridging and also provide liquidity for this service

despite functioning it is still a work in progress. there are probably bugs

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

under construction:

- make the trading page more like an order book
- cross-network bridge. service provider can create a swap offer that lets a customer bridge any asset between any two networks with the same public key format (i.e. Arbitrum to Ethereum L1, BSC to Optimism, etc). fees are paid in VEO.

known bugs

- user can only accept one trade per event per amoveo block
